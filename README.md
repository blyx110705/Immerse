A small simulation of Blackjack

Installation
-----------------------
Python 3.9
Random library


Usage
-----------------------
The way to win is to get 21, or by special rules like getting an Ace with a 10 value card or two of the same value cards. 
You lose when you get over 21 (bust)
you and the computer will be dealt a hand, you won't be able to see 1 of the computer cards initiialy, but can see if it hits
you will get two options, hit or stand
Hit, you would normally do this when your hand is quite small, you then get dealt another card
Stand, you would normally do this when you think your hand is large enough to beat the computer
